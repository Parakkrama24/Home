<h3>What is the quality cording </h3>

Qulaity cording is not a roket sceince . We are using computer programming every time. Qulity cording is realted to the programmin best practices.But in this time I am using another senario for easy understanding.

We are eating parippu every time right?.Or what ever meal do you like.I pariipu best flavore comming from it cooking best practices.First we should wash pariipu. Next we should add some kulubadu . After that we should haet that . That case have some prosdure. That time we can get good flavore. Other wise we can't eat parippu or what evaer meal.same thing is apply for the quality cording.

We are using some prosidures for write qulaity cords.

<h3>Why we need code Qulity </h3>

<ul>
<li>high-quality code allows programs to run efficiently.</li>
<li>makes it easier for teammates to understand and 
contribute.</li>
<li>makes maintenance and future updates smoother, 
saving time and resources in the long run.</li>
