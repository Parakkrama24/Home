<h3>What is Quality Coding?</h3>

<p>
  Quality coding is not rocket science. We use computer programming all the time, and quality coding is related to programming best practices. Let's use a different scenario for easy understanding.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine cooking your favorite meal, like parippu. The best flavor of parippu comes from following the best cooking practices. First, wash the parippu. Next, add some spices. Then, heat it. This process has specific procedures that, when followed, result in good flavor. Similarly, quality coding involves following procedures to write efficient and understandable code.

<h3>Why Do We Need Code Quality?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>High-quality code allows programs to run efficiently.
    <p>If we use a lower big(O) value for our code, it runs efficiently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Makes it easier for teammates to understand and contribute.
    <p>Clean and quality code is easy to read and understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Makes maintenance and future updates smoother, saving time and resources.
    <p>Clean and quality code can be easily extended and modified.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
